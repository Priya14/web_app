                      My expectations from the workshop was merely to understand the Rails framework, and get over the initial pain that a developer goes through in the process of learning a new framework/technology himself. However, what I got in this workshop was much more than that.
                    %p
                      The content was very well hand-picked and prepared to provide the essential knowledge as well as to keep the audience interested throughout. The hands-on session were a very good supplemented to the theory classes.

                      Arun is one of the thorough professionals and the in-depth knowledge of the topics showed during the workshop. The personal touch to the training - of ensuring that the pace matched every single person on-board was a stand-out feature!
