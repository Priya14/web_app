                %p BDD helps to write test cases in a natural language that non-programmers can read and there by facilitates in obtaining clear understanding of desired software behavior.
                %p During this two day hands-on workshop, you will learn about 
                %p * Ruby on Rails
                %p * Developing Rails 3.0 app
                %p * Distributed Version Control with Git and Github

                    %p 
                      My expectations from the workshop was merely to understand the Rails framework, and get over the initial pain that a developer goes through in the process of learning a new framework/technology himself. However, what I got in this workshop was much more than that.
                    %p
                      The content was very well hand-picked and prepared to provide the essential knowledge as well as to keep the audience interested throughout. The hands-on session were a very good supplemented to the theory classes.
                    %p
                      Arun is one of the thorough professionals and the in-depth knowledge of the topics showed during the workshop. The personal touch to the training - of ensuring that the pace matched every single person on-board was a stand-out feature!
