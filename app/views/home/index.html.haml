                    Ruby on Rails is the cleanest and fastest way to develop industrial strength web applications. It is based on the awesome Ruby language, and by adhering to principles like convention over configuration and DRY, it makes the developer's life pretty easy. In fact, Rails is pure fun!

                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Behavior Driven Development(BDD) is a second generation agile methodology that grew out of the frustrations the first generation agilists faced with Test Driven Development. BDD encourages collaboration between developers, QA and business participants in a software project. BDD helps to write test cases in a natural language that non-programmers can read and there by facilitates in obtaining clear understanding of desired software behavior.

            %h3.normal  We love agile and lean methodologies. We believe in continuous integration and continuous delivery. We don't like to surprise the customer at the end of the project and we don't want to be surprised ourselves as well! We follow an iterative model and deliver frequently.
